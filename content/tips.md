# Tips for Optimal Signal Strength

Ensuring a strong and stable signal for your Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)'s antennas, Mi-Fi routers, phones can significantly improve your online experience. Here are some tips to help you align your equipment and maximize signal strength:

## Find the Nearest Base Station

- Use the provided Google Maps link to locate nearest antenna sector.
- Buy SIM card from one of the closest service provider, this ensures that you have the best signal strength & quality
- Align your location with the azimuth of the nearest base station's antenna sector.

## Note on Environmental factors

- In densely populated areas, be aware of potential signal reflections from buildings that can either enhance or weaken signal quality. 
- The amount of background users, especially in busy hour can severly impact your user experience (achievable throughput), which in case of dense areas might require switching to different operator

## Avoiding Interference

- Mind the distance from power lines to reduce Block Error Rate (BLER).
- Be aware of physical obstructions that might block or reflect the signal.

## Optimize Equipment Placement

- For MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) setups, ensure your equipment are correctly positioned to maximize signal reflections.
- Perform multiple speed tests to find the best location for your equipment.
